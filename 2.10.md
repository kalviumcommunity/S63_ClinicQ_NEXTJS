Environment Variable Management

In this concept, you’ll learn how to manage environment variables and secrets safely within your Next.js project. You’ll create the required .env files, ensure sensitive information is never exposed to the client, and document your setup clearly in the README.

Note: These are general guidelines. You may customize your setup, naming, and documentation according to your allocated problem statement and team context.

What You’ll Do
Set Up Environment Files

Create two files in the project root:

.env.local
.env.example
Use .env.local for actual credentials (e.g., database URLs, API keys) that should never be committed.

Use .env.example as a template — list all required variables with placeholder values and comments explaining their purpose and scope. Example:

# Server-side variables
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname

# Client-side variables (must start with NEXT_PUBLIC_)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
Ensure Safe Server-Side Access

In Next.js, only variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are exposed to the client.

Use process.env safely in your code:

const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL; // server-side only
const apiUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL; // safe for client
Validate that your server-only secrets are not used inside client components or hooks.

Protect Secrets

Add .env.local to your .gitignore file to prevent accidental commits.

Example:

# Ignore local environment files
.env*
!.env.example
Confirm that your repo only contains .env.example, not .env.local.

Document in README

In your README, explain:

The purpose of each environment variable
Which variables are server-side only and which are safe for client-side access
How to replicate your setup using .env.example
Common pitfalls you avoided (e.g., accidentally exposing secrets, forgetting prefixes, runtime vs build-time issues)
Deliverables
.env.local and .env.example files correctly configured
Updated README with environment variable documentation
.gitignore protecting secrets from being pushed
Screenshots or code snippets showing safe process.env usage
Pro Tip: Proper environment management is a hallmark of a professional developer — it keeps your app secure, portable, and production-ready.
