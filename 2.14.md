Prisma ORM Setup & Client Initialisation

In this concept, you’ll learn how to integrate Prisma ORM into your Next.js project, generate the Prisma client, and connect it to your PostgreSQL database. This setup will serve as the foundation for all your database queries and models across your full-stack application.

Note: These are general guidelines — you may customize your models, directory structure, or configuration according to your allocated problem statement and project requirements.

What You’ll Do
Install and Initialize Prisma

From your project root, run:

npm install prisma --save-dev
npx prisma init
This creates a new folder /prisma with a schema.prisma file and an .env entry:

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/mydb"
Define Your Models

In the prisma/schema.prisma file, define your database models based on your earlier schema design. Example:

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model User {
  id        Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  email     String    @unique
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  projects  Project[]
}

model Project {
  id        Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  userId    Int
  user      User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
Generate the Prisma Client

After saving the schema, run:

npx prisma generate
This generates the Prisma Client that you can import into your Next.js app for querying the database.

Connect Prisma to Your Application

Inside src/lib/, create a file named prisma.ts:

import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const globalForPrisma = global as unknown as { prisma: PrismaClient };

export const prisma =
  globalForPrisma.prisma ||
  new PrismaClient({
    log: ['query', 'info', 'warn', 'error'],
  });

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;
This ensures a single Prisma instance is reused during development, avoiding multiple client initializations.

Test the Connection

Create a simple test query to verify the setup:

import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma';

export async function getUsers() {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
  console.log(users);
}
Run your app (npm run dev) and confirm the database connection is successful.

Document Everything in README

Add a section in your README.md explaining:

The purpose of Prisma ORM in your project
The setup steps you followed
A snippet of your schema and client initialization file
Screenshots or logs showing a successful client connection and query
Reflection on how Prisma improves type safety, query reliability, and developer productivity
Deliverables
Prisma installed and initialized (schema.prisma, /prisma folder)
Models defined based on project schema
Prisma Client generated successfully
Working database connection verified
README updated with explanation, evidence, and reflections
Pro Tip: Prisma bridges your backend and database seamlessly — combining type safety, auto-generated queries, and developer efficiency in one powerful tool.
