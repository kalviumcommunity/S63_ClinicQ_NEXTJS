Project Initialisation & Folder Structure

Welcome to your first hands-on deliverable of Sprint #1! This task is about setting up your base repository - the foundation on which your entire full-stack project will grow. You’ll create a clean, scalable Next.js (TypeScript) setup with a clear folder hierarchy and meaningful documentation.

Note: These are general submission guidelines. You may customize your prompts, PR titles, and README reflections to fit your allocated problem statement and team context.

Task Overview
Initialize a Next.js (TypeScript) Project

Create a new project using:

npx create-next-app@latest your-project-name --typescript
Verify that it runs locally on http://localhost:3000.

Set Up a Standard Folder Structure Maintain a consistent and modular structure:

src/
├── app/          # Routes & pages (App Router)
├── components/   # Reusable UI components
├── lib/          # Utilities, helpers, configs
Add a .gitignore to exclude node_modules, .env, .next, etc.

Update your README.md to document:

Purpose of each folder
Naming conventions
How this structure supports scalability and clarity
Run & Capture Evidence

Start your app (npm run dev) and take a screenshot of it running locally.
Embed the screenshot in your README file.
README Guidelines
Your README.md should include:

Project Title and short description of your problem statement
Folder structure and explanation of each directory
Setup instructions (installation, local run)
Reflection: Why this structure? How will it help your team scale your app in future sprints?
Screenshot of your local app running
🔗 Submission Guidelines
Create a Pull Request (PR)
Once ready:

Commit your setup with a clear message:

feat: initialized Next.js TypeScript project with standard folder structure
Push your branch and create a Pull Request titled:

[Sprint-1] Project Initialization & Folder Structure – TeamName
In your PR description, include:

A brief summary of what you implemented
Screenshot(s) from your README
Short reflection or team notes
Any decisions made specific to your problem statement
Record a Short Video Demo
Keep it 1–2 minutes long.
Show your app running locally and walk through the folder structure.
Briefly explain what each directory does and why it’s organized that way.
Upload your video to Google Drive, Loom, or YouTube (unlisted) and paste the link in your PR description.
Pro Tip: Use this as your team’s foundation — keep it clean, documented, and flexible. Your PRs, commits, and documentation style here will set the tone for all future sprints!
